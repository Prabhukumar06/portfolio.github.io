<h2>Gowtham GM</h2>
<p><h3>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A warm thanks to the Tap Academy team.
           I am Gowtham GM from Tamilnadu, a 2024 passed-out student.
           I joined Tap Academy as a CSR student in the month of February. 
           My journey with Tap Academy is quite different. The trainers at Tap Academy are skilled and experienced. 
           They teach a lot of new concepts and help in learning programming languages from scratch.
           I am from the Computer Science branch, but the teaching at Tap Academy is structured in a way that makes 
           it easy for students from all domains to understand the concepts and technology taught by the trainers.<br>
           &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, I got placed as a Software Engineer at Revature with a package of 3.25 LPA.
           The placement team helped me a lot in securing this job.
           Thank you to the entire Tap Academy team for helping me acquire this opportunity.</h3></p>

<h2>Varshaa M</h2>   
<p><h3>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I'm a student from the Feb 2 batch, and I'm happy to share my experience with Tap Academy. They visited 
           our college in Tamil Nadu and selected students for their CSR batch, 
           offering a free course that's been incredibly helpful. Compared to other academies,
           Tap Academy stands out for its excellent trainers, who explain complex concepts in a clear and concise manner, 
           start from scratch, making it easy for beginners to understand, and provide in-depth coverage of programming and OOPS concepts, 
           highly valuable for placement opportunities. I'm grateful to have been selected by Avasoft with the role of Trainee Engineer with a package
           of 5 LPA through college placement, and I attribute my success to Tap Academy's incredible teaching,
           as I used the same approach they taught me during them mock interview process. Additionally, 
           Tap Academy offers comprehensive notebooks and study materials, an LMS platform with daily class recordings, 
           a TAl platform for practicing daily programming questions, weekly assessments, and monthly mock assessments and Interviews, 
           boosting placement confidence, as well as soft skill classes focusing on logical thinking.</h3></p>
